## Projects

### ðŸ“¡ [Tapered Slot Antenna Design for Ground Penetrating Radar Applications](files/gpr.pdf)
: This project focused on the design and analysis of a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA), which offers superior efficiency and bandwidth performance for modern wireless applications. Using ANSYS HFSS, the DRA geometry, material properties, and feed mechanism were optimized to meet target frequency and gain requirements.

- **Technologies:** ANSYS HFSS

### ðŸŽµ [Generative Music AI using LSTM Networks](files/AI.pdf)
An AI system that composes original music using LSTM neural networks trained on MIDI datasets. By learning patterns in melodies and harmonies, the model generates creative musical sequences.

- **Technologies:** Matlab, MIDI Toolbox
- [View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/beyzilop/Music-AI)

### ðŸŒ± Split Ring Resonator (SRR)-Based Sensor for Plant Growth Estimation
This project introduces a sensing system based on Split Ring Resonators (SRR) for contactless estimation of plant growth. By tracking resonance frequency shifts caused by changes in plant biomass and water content, the system offers a non-invasive alternative to traditional plant monitoring methods

- **Technologies:** ANSYS HFSS

## About Me

Merhaba, uzay teknolojilerine bÃ¼yÃ¼k bir ilgi duyuyorum ve Ã¶zellikle anten tasarÄ±mÄ± alanÄ±nda deneyim kazandÄ±m.
AldÄ±ÄŸÄ±m sinyal iÅŸleme, analog ve dijital haberleÅŸme, elektronik ve nesne temelli programlama dersleri sayesinde bu alanda gerekli temel donanÄ±ma sahibim.

Fernganiâ€™de yaz stajÄ± yaparak hem teorik bilgilerimi pekiÅŸtirmek hem de uzay teknolojileri alanÄ±nda kendimi geliÅŸtirmek istiyorum.

Ä°lginiz ve deÄŸerlendirmeniz iÃ§in teÅŸekkÃ¼r ederim.
