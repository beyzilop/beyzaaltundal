## Projects

### ðŸ“¡ [Tapered Slot Antenna Design for Ground Penetrating Radar Applications](files/gpr.pdf)
: This project focused on the design and analysis of a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA), which offers superior efficiency and bandwidth performance for modern wireless applications. Using ANSYS HFSS, the DRA geometry, material properties, and feed mechanism were optimized to meet target frequency and gain requirements.

- **Technologies:** ANSYS HFSS

### ðŸŒ± Split Ring Resonator (SRR)-Based Sensor for Plant Growth Estimation
This project introduces a sensing system based on Split Ring Resonators (SRR) for contactless estimation of plant growth. By tracking resonance frequency shifts caused by changes in plant biomass and water content, the system offers a non-invasive alternative to traditional plant monitoring methods

- **Technologies:** ANSYS HFSS

## About Me

I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering, which gave me a strong foundation in technology, systems, and problem-solving. However, during my studies, I discovered a growing passion for coding and software development. Thatâ€™s why Commencis stands out to me â€” as a company at the forefront of digital transformation, it offers the ideal environment for me to develop my coding skills, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to cutting-edge projects. Iâ€™m excited to take this step and transition into the software field, combining my analytical background with new programming skills to build my career in technology..
